# Frontend-Backend Integration Setup

## ✅ Configuration Complete

### 1. API Gateway Endpoint
Your API Gateway endpoint has been automatically detected and configured:

```typescript
export const AWS_CONFIG = {
  endpoints: {
    // Your actual API Gateway endpoint
    apiGateway: 'https://a1kn0j91k8.execute-api.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/prod',
  },
  // ... rest of config
};
```

### 2. CORS Configuration
✅ **CORS has been automatically configured** for all endpoints:
- `POST /chat` - Chat functionality
- `POST /knowledge-base` - Document management
- `POST /orders` - Order management

All endpoints now include proper CORS headers:
- `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`
- `Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET,POST,PUT,DELETE,OPTIONS`
- `Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type,X-Amz-Date,Authorization,X-Api-Key,X-Amz-Security-Token`

### 3. Environment Variables (Optional)
Create a `.env` file in the root directory if you want to override:

```env
VITE_API_GATEWAY_URL=https://a1kn0j91k8.execute-api.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/prod
```

**Note**: Vite uses `VITE_` prefix for environment variables instead of `REACT_APP_`.

## Backend Integration Status

✅ **Completed:**
- Removed CloudFormation templates and deployment scripts
- Updated API client to match backend endpoints
- Integrated chatbot with real API calls
- Removed all mock data
- Added proper error handling
- Added loading states

## API Endpoints Used

### Chat Endpoints
- `POST /chat` - Send chat message (with action-based routing)
- Session management handled on frontend

### Knowledge Base Endpoints
- `POST /knowledge-base` - Upload documents (action: 'upload')
- `POST /knowledge-base` - Scrape websites (action: 'scrape')
- `POST /knowledge-base` - List documents (action: 'list')

### Order Endpoints
- `POST /orders` - Look up order status (with order_id)
- `POST /orders` - Initialize sample orders (action: 'init')

## Features

- Sample data initialization

## Testing

1. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser

3. Test the chat functionality with your deployed backend

## Notes

- The frontend now makes real API calls to your AWS Lambda functions
- All mock data has been removed
- Error handling is implemented for network failures
- Loading states provide user feedback
- The application is ready for production use with your deployed backend
