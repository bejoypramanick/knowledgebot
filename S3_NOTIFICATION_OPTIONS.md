# S3 Notification Configuration - You Have Options

## What's Happening

The `S3NotificationsStack` was setting up **automatic** document processing - whenever a PDF is uploaded to S3, it automatically triggers the document processor Lambda.

But if your UI is **manually triggering** processing via the `/process` API Gateway endpoint, you have these options:

## Option 1: Skip S3 Notification Stack (Recommended for Manual Triggers)

**Pros:**
- No duplicate processing
- Full control from UI
- Simpler architecture
- No stuck CloudFormation stacks

**Cons:**
- Must manually trigger processing
- Risk of forgetting to process documents

**Implementation:**
Don't deploy the `S3NotificationsStack`. The UI will call `/process` manually after upload.

## Option 2: Use Both (Backup Automation)

**Pros:**
- If UI fails, S3 auto-triggers processing
- Redundancy
- No lost documents

**Cons:**
- May process documents twice (needs idempotency in processor)
- More complex

**Implementation:**
Keep the stack but ensure processor is idempotent (checks if already processed).

## Option 3: S3 Notifications Only (No UI Trigger)

**Pros:**
- Fully automated
- No manual steps

**Cons:**
- No upload progress feedback
- Can't choose processing parameters

**Implementation:**
Keep the stack, remove UI `/process` calls.

## Current Recommendation

Based on your code, you're **manually triggering** via `triggerDocumentProcessing()` in `knowledge-base.ts`:

```typescript
const processResult = await knowledgeBaseManager.triggerDocumentProcessing(
  presignedUrlData.bucket,
  presignedUrlData.key
);
```

**So you should skip the S3NotificationsStack** - it's redundant and caused issues.

## How to Skip It

In your CloudFormation parent stack template, make `S3NotificationsStack` optional or comment it out. Or in Terraform/CDK, conditionally create it only when you want automatic triggers.

The deleted stack won't be recreated automatically - your parent stack should handle this gracefully if it's optional.

## Next Steps

1. âœ… The stuck stack is now being deleted
2. The parent stack should complete without it
3. Your manual triggers will continue working via `/process` endpoint
4. Consider removing the S3NotificationsStack from your infrastructure templates if you don't need auto-triggers
